## Networking Basics

* An OSI(Open Systems Interconnection) is a conceptual model that standardizes
  the communication functions of a networking system and support operability
  between different products and software

* The OSI has seven layers:
	* Physical
	* Data Link
	* Network
	* Transport
	* Session
	* Presentation and Application

* A LAN(Local Area Network) is a type of network that spans a relatively short
  area. It operates majorly on Ethernet and Token Ring technologies.

* A WAN(Wide Area Network)is a type of network that spans a large area.
  The Internet, for example is a WAN,(the largest).

* An IP(Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label attached to a network
  that uses IP for communication.
  IP addresses have two types, TCP and MAC addresses.

* **localhost** is a hostname that refers to the current conputer being used.

* A **subnet** or subnetwork, is a network inside a network. Such architecture
  improves network efficiency alongside other advantages...

* IPv6 was creates because it was estimated that the number of IPv4 addresses
  would exhaust in the near future considering the trend of increasing tech.

* The two mainly used data transfer protocols for IP are TCP and UDP
  TCP(Transfer Control Protocol) is an IP that delivers and receives data in an
  ordered and error-checked stream.
  UDP(User Datagram Protocol) on the other hand communicates with other devices
  sending streams of information without error-checking.

* A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end.

* SSH(Secure Shell) is a Protocol that provides a secure communication between
  two computers over an insecure network.

* HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol that provides a connection
  between a computer and a server. It is not secure
  **HTTPS** is a more secure version of HTTP, communicating data in a secure
  manner.

* Ping is an ICMP which can be used as a tool to check connectivity info.
