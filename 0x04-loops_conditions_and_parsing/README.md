#!/bin/env bash
* SSH Keys can be generated in linux by running the command *ssh-keygen -t rsa*

* #!/bin/env bash is more advantageous than #!/bin/bash due to its portability.

* In sh scripts, loops take the format:
  while [CONTROL COMMAND]; do [CONSEQUENT COMMAND]; done
  for [NAME] in [LIST]; do [COMMAND]; done
  until [TEST COMMAND]; do [CONSEQUENT COMMAND]; done

* cut removes lines or sections from files.
