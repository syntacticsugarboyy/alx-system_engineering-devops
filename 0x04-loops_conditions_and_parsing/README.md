* #!/bin/env bash is more advantageous than #!/bin/bash due to its portability.

* In sh scripts, loops take the format:
  while [CONTROL COMMAND]; do [CONSEQUENT COMMAND]; done
  for [NAME] in [LIST]; do [COMMAND]; done
  until [TEST COMMAND]; do [CONSEQUENT COMMAND]; done

* If, else, elif and case conditional statements are pretty much the same as C.
  The only slight difference are the parameters e.g -eq meaning equals to...

* cut removes lines or sections from files.
