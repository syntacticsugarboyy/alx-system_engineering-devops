## Networking basics...

* **localhost 127.0.0.1** is known as a *loopback* address. It is the server on
  your own computer.

* **0.0.0.0** as an IP address has different meanings based on context, could
  be a source address for a host or *localhost* for some devices.

* **/etc/hosts** file in linux is a plain text file that is used to translate
  URLs into IP adresses by mapping connections between IP addresses and domain
  names.

* The **netstat** command can be used to display a machine's active network.
  Simply running the command ``netstat -a`` should do.
